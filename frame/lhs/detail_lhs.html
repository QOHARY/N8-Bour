                        <p class="card-text text-light">LHS 1140 b is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its mass is 6.38 Earths, it takes 24.7 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.0957 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2017.

                        <h5 class="card-title text-light">How It Was Discovered</h5>
                        <p class="card-text text-light"> An exoplanet orbiting a small star some 50 light-years away from Earth may be a life-friendly water world, a new study has revealed — and the James Webb Space Telescope could determine if that is indeed the case. <br>
                        The planet in question, called LHS 1140b, orbits in the habitable zone of a small, dim star called LHS 1140 that lies in the constellation Cetus. The exoplanet was discovered in 2017 and has been observed by multiple telescopes since. <br>
                        These observations first convinced researchers that LHS 1140b is a rocky planet about 1.7 times wider than Earth. But a new analysis of all available observations has shown that LHS 1140b is not dense enough to be purely rocky and must either contain much more water than Earth or possess an extensive atmosphere full of light elements such as hydrogen and helium.

                        <h5 class="card-title">Water World?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">They found that LHS1140 b must have a bulk density less than that of Earth but still much higher than those of the giant planets. After further modeling, the team was left with two very different scenarios for how a planet could arrive in this in-between gray zone. Either LHS 1140 b has a very light, puffy atmosphere of hydrogen and helium overlaying a rocky surface, or, more exotically, LHS1140 b is a “water world,” likely covered in ice with a pocket of liquid water.

                        <p class="card-text">LHS 1140 b, the exoplanet orbits a red dwarf star about a fifth the size of the sun and sits 48 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cetus which, as luck would have it, translates to "the whale." But most important about LHS 1140 b is the fact that it lives in its star's habitable zone, otherwise known as its "Goldilocks zone." As that nickname would suggest, this is the area around a star where it's neither too hot nor too cold for a world to host liquid water, but rather fits the standard by which the fairy tale character Goldilocks lives. There's also a second major win for the world.</p>

                        <p class="card-text"> the JWST data further suggests the exoplanet's mass might be made of between 10 percent and 20 percent liquid water — and, "Current models indicate that if LHS 1140 b has an Earth-like atmosphere, it would be a snowball planet with a bull's-eye ocean about 4,000 kilometers [2,485 miles] in diameter," the statement says, adding that the surface temperature of the ocean may very well even be a  "comfortable" 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).

                        <p class="card-text">Charles Cadieux, University of Montreal, took up this challenge and led a team to reprocess nearly every byte of information collected on these worlds in an attempt to better constrain their masses and radii. They succeeded: as the authors put it, “the LHS 1140 planets are [now] among the best-characterized exoplanets to date, with relative uncertainties of only 3% for the mass and 2% for the radius.”
